# repository-baseline-policy.md §5.1: a badge whose value is written by a human
# is forbidden — it renders identically to a real one, so a reader cannot tell
# them apart, and it becomes false the moment reality moves without anyone
# editing a file. This repo carried no coverage badge at all; the README now
# renders whatever this script last wrote to `coverage.json` on the orphan
# `badges` branch. The number therefore comes from the same `.coverage` file
# the gate in pyproject.toml's [tool.coverage.report] fail_under exits
# non-zero on, and it moves on its own.
#
# Runs from .github/workflows/ci.yml on pushes to main only, from the
# python-3.13 leg. The `badges` branch is seeded before this script is ever
# invoked, so the contents API is enough and no branch is ever created here.
